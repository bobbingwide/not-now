## Description 
* NOT-NOW: Hides admin notices until you're ready to deal with them

Do you find that when you visit your website and log in you get shown a load of notices that you're not interested in right now.
You want to do the job you logged in to do, not deal with all these pesky messages.

What's the first thing that comes into your mind when you see the messages.
One of these perhaps:

- I'm busy
- It's not a good time
- Keep it to yourself
- So what?
- Yeah really?
- You know how to spoil a good day
- P*ss off
- F*uck off
- Unprintable



NOT NOW! I'm not interested in your admin_notices. Not now, not never. Well, hardly ever.

Inspired by Franco Federico's 'oy' routine?
